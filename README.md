# Electron-Direction-Fitter
A convolutional neural network for determining the initial direction of a electron recoil

## 2D
The 2D folder uses projected tracks and a 2DCNN implemented via keras

##explore_raw_data.ipynb:
Exploratory jupyter notebook which demonstrates the following:
1. Reading raw simulation finals 
2. Visualizing the raw simulation files 
3. Obtaining an random direction drawn from a isotropic distribution
4. Rotating tracks to the random direction and applying diffusion
5. Mean-centering the tracks
